Whew, a bit of a delay here, kind of a crazy time (for everyone, I'm sure).

I just cleaned up and posted the slides from my NLP course on github, check them all out [here](https://github.com/bpben/nlp_lessons).

This includes everything! If you're interested in a specific topic, here's each week and a link to the specific set of slides:

1) History of NLP and tokenization [slides](https://github.com/bpben/nlp_lessons/blob/master/distribute_week_1_intro.pdf) [notebook](https://github.com/bpben/nlp_lessons/blob/master/notebooks_instructor/week_1_intro.ipynb)
2) From tokens to vectors [slides](https://github.com/bpben/nlp_lessons/blob/master/distribute_week_2_vectors.pdf) [notebook](https://github.com/bpben/nlp_lessons/blob/master/notebooks_instructor/week_2_vectors.ipynb)
3) Bringing in context (RNNs/LSTMs) [slides](https://github.com/bpben/nlp_lessons/blob/master/distribute_week_3_context.pdf) [notebook](https://github.com/bpben/nlp_lessons/blob/master/notebooks_instructor/week_3_context.ipynb)
