title: New website!

Just wanted to put a small announcement up here about my [new, shiny website](benbatorsky.com).  Shiny as in lustrous, not RShiny :P

I have an overview of some of the projects I've been working on and some more information about me.

I hope to include some highlights from this blog up there, as I've really enjoyed working on the entries I have here.

I welcome any ideas/suggestions folks have!
