Happy new year! You may have noticed a few...changes here.

Thanks to the awesome work of the [wowthemes](https://wowthemes.net/) team, I now have this stylish new blog.  Since I've been putting a lot of content out recently, I figured having a cleaner, more navigable format would be helpful for people looking around.

This month, I intend to make a bunch of progress on some of the independent projects I've been working on with various teams.  Check out the these tags if you're interested in following along:

[LLM Apps series](https://bpben.github.io/categories.html#llm%20app%20series)

[AI + Dermatology with Melatech](https://bpben.github.io/categories.html#dermatology)

[Reviews of cutting edge papers](https://bpben.github.io/categories.html#papers)

Hope you'll stay connected here! Remember you can always [connect with me via assorted social media](https://bpben.github.io/authors-list.html)
