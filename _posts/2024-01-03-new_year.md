Happy new year! You may have noticed a few...changes here.

Thanks to the awesome work of the [wowthemes](https://wowthemes.net/) team, I now have this stylish new blog.  Since I've been putting a lot of content out recently, I figured having a cleaner, more navigable format would be helpful for people looking around.

This month, I intend to make a bunch of progress on some of the independent projects I've been working on with various teams.  Check out the these tags if you're interested in following along:

[LLM Apps series]({{site.url}}/categories.html#llm-app-series)

[AI + Dermatology with Melatech]({{site.url}}/categories.html#dermatology)

[Reviews of cutting edge papers]({{site.url}}/categories.html#papers)

Hope you'll stay connected here! Remember you can always [connect with me via assorted social media]({{site.url}}/authors-list.html)

PS: The post image is at Angkor Wat in Cambodia.  So, it hasn't all been hard work the past couple months :)
