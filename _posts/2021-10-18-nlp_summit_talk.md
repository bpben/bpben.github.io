title: Bias and Ethics in NLP Talk
---

Still working on getting more content up here, but thought in the meantime I'd share a talk I gave at the Spark NLP Summit earlier this month.

Here is the [link to the recorded talk](https://www.nlpsummit.org/new-methods-old-problems-ethics-and-bias-in-modern-natural-language-processing/)

And [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aoI7xMvg76lOZ-2F9vQEsfa2W_c9Dd4AcgsPJoI30cA)

I find it a really interesting topic and would be happy to discuss further if folks are interested.

More to come!
