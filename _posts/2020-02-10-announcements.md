title: Strata AI talk and Harvard class
---

Happy new year!

I'm a little late with that (and posting generally) but I swear it's for good reason.  I have at least two:

I'll be presenting my talk [Named-Entity Recognition From Scratch](https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata-data-ai/stai-ca/public/schedule/detail/80050) at [O'Reilly's Strata Data Conference in San Jose](https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata-data-ai/stai-ca) in March.  I'm super excited (also nervous) to be up there with all the other people doing super exciting work int he area.

I'll be posting the slides/materials in the coming weeks.  I'll also be putting together some conference recap slides that I'll share.

I'm also going to be teaching a course [Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing
](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses-by-certificate/data-science-certificate/text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing/34793) at the Harvard Extension School in the summer.  I'll aim to post materials from the class here and on my github.

Lots of really exciting things coming up! I also have notes from a few more lectures from MIT's Statistical Learning course that I'll be writing up.  So look forward to that!

Much more to come! And this time it won't be two months (promise!)
