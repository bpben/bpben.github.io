Holy moly am I the king of dropping the ball here.  I had put this recap together based on some of the really awesome talks I attended during [PyData Global](https://global.pydata.org/) and then promptly forgot about it.

Here's my [recap slides for PyData Global](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rje4ruHZstCB1SqpYn0Hg1GFkd7tMKZ_3ZTczcUFw8k/edit?usp=sharing).

These are just some of the amazing talks that I got the opportunity to listen in on.  I made some [additional notes on other talks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FoY2CUfI_wdq495N_zFKioxLRM66yBLlctJEUpE35pk/edit?usp=sharing) if you don't mind a bit of stream-of-consciousness.

As a reminder, I have some recaps from other conferences I've attended available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lAVDNU0lskdH4M7UzxwGjHw8KlspLFCv?usp=sharing).  The data community at large is amazing and I always learn a ton just casually attending these.

Let me know if you have comments/questions/suggestions for other talks!
