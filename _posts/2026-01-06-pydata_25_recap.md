It's that time again - Conference recap time! And this time a very special one; the first EVER PyData Boston Conference!

This was such a great experience and an amazing environment for connection and learning.  There's something about open source software that encourages collaboration, openness and sharing.  I guess that kind of makes sense :)

PyData Boston had 39 talks, 11 tutorials, including a "keynote track" that featured amazing speakers like [Isabelle Zimmerman](https://isabelizimm.me/) and [Lisa Amini](https://research.ibm.com/people/lisa-amini).

All of these talks are [FREE online for your viewing pleasure](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGVZCDnMOq0rhHGZp727T3aRoUYwXXxQJ)

I attended a set of these talks and wrote up my notes in a short deck that I _know_ doesn't do justice to the depth of discussion of the topics.  But hopefully they're helpful for you to select talks you want to dig into further.  These decks definitely help me when I want to refresh myself on the talks.  So hopefully they help you too!
