The last few months have been very busy! I'll be slow-releasing some of the materials I've been working on.

First release is a new and improved version of my [Ben Needs a Friend tutorial](https://github.com/bpben/ben_friend_25)!

Besides updating the material, I switched to using [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), which makes for a much snappier, more consistent set of examples.  Today at [ODSC East](https://odsc.com/speakers/ben-needs-a-friend-building-a-customized-llm-based-assistant/) participants were able to get up and running with the examples quickly.  Hopefully this will work for you all of you as well!

This version is much shorter and to the point - the focus is on getting these small examples running without digging too much in depth into the technical details.  Definitely take a look at the [previous version]({{site.url}}/ben_friend_release)

Some lessons I learned from talking to the crowd:
* As might be expected, people are excited about the agent workflows.  People wanted to see more on this, and potentially that'll be something I'll be digging into more with examples in the future
* Interestingly, there was also a lot of excitement around the fine-tuning example.  I realize I should have spent more time on that as well, since people really wanted me to dive in further about best practices.  More research for me!

I'll be following up again here with a recap of ODSC East 2025 - stay tuned!
