title: ODSC 2019 recap
---

Sorry, all, for not updating for a while.  Big job change happened back in June so I'm just now getting my head above water.  That'll have to be my (insufficient) excuse for taking so long to put out my Open Data Science Conference recap for 2019 just now.

[ODSC 2019 Recap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1beGzD2Pep6XhfvKB3CpU3kCVJsfNk7mrURHC44EJrbo/edit?usp=sharing)

There was a lot of really fascinating talks this year and I highlighted some of the ones I attended.  There were a lot of implementation-focused talks I went to, including two focusing on process management, specifically using Airflow.  I give a brief outline of the talk, but the speaker materials are really where it's at, so I suggest taking a look.

Just as a reminder, I have [some other recaps](https://bpben.github.io/2018/12/08/conference-recaps/), and I've [collected them all here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lAVDNU0lskdH4M7UzxwGjHw8KlspLFCv?usp=sharing) if you're interested in taking a look.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments or if you'd like to discuss any of the material here.

More to come soon!
