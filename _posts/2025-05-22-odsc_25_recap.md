Conference recap time! I always love putting these together, I feel like it helps me solidify my understanding of the material and gives me something to refer back to when I think of one of the talks I've been to.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DNYD4ckaLY_dM00-3U36infn3TH4XeE_WMJnRzsSA4Y/edit?usp=sharing) are the recap slides.

Some highlights:

[Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/)! 

I'm super excited to see how this library develops.  I'm a big fan of the Pydantic library.  It fills a crucial need, it's easy to understand and their documentation is top-notch.  I like the idea of applying this kind of structure-oriented approach to building agents

[Seth Weidman's talk on PPO and GRPO](https://github.com/SethHWeidman/odsc_east_2025_grpo_llama).

I thought the way he explained how RL training happens was clearer than I've seen in much of the other material I've read.  I hope I captured the idea accurately here in the slide, but breaking out the "rollout" and "training" phases made this much more clear to me.  Previously I had been under the impression it was more of a single action, prediction and loss computation, versus this "collection" of actions.

I didn't get to go through the notebooks extensively, but it's great to have this as a resource.

[Arvind Narayanan on the future of AI agents](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691249131/ai-snake-oil)

I thought this was an excellent, balanced view on what AI Agents are and are not.  He was realistic; we need benchmarks based in reality and measurement done in a much more systematic (and independent) way.  I don't have his slides, but I think this article covers [some of his views](https://opendatascience.com/beyond-the-hype-rethinking-ais-role-in-society-with-arvind-narayanan/).
