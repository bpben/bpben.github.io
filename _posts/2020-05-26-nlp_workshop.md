title: PyData NLP Workshop
---

Tomorrow I'll be hosting a virtual meetup with PyData demonstrating some basic techniques in NLP! 

Check out [the repo](https://github.com/bpben/pydata_nlp_workshop) and [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UICJ1bhgmNVQ_JYVuhOLYiTvKSmzNfosXlGkUZWVnkI).

This is mainly drawing on the material from weeks 1 and 2 of my course, but I try to distill it down a bit for the shortened format.

Hope to see folks there!
