      bio:            "I am the type of person who appreciates the telling of a great story.  
      As a data scientist, I am interested in using AI to understand, explore and communicate across borders and boundaries.  
      My focus is on Natural Language Processing and the amazing ways it can help us understand each other and our world.  
      The material on this blog is meant to share my experiences and understandings of complex technologies in a simple way, focused on application."
